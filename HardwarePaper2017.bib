abstract = {This paper presents a novel design for a modular snake-like robot with magnetic coupling between the modules. Each module combines 3D-printed mechanical parts with widely available standard electronic components, resulting in a highly customizable, low-cost robot platform for research and education. Since simulation and 3D-printing rely on the same model-files, the design also integrates smoothly into simulation environments like OpenRAVE. The robot can be assembled and re-assembled on the fly. Automatic topology detection is realized with custom connection-interfaces and dynamic initialization of intermodule communication.},

abstract = {Artificial evolution of physical systems is a stochastic optimization method in which physical machines are iteratively adapted to a target function. The key for a meaningful design optimization is the capability to build variations of physical machines through the course of the evolutionary process. The optimization in turn no longer relies on complex physics models that are prone to the reality gap, a mismatch between simulated and real-world behavior. We report model-free development and evaluation of phenotypes in the artificial evolution of physical systems, in which a mother robot autonomously designs and assembles locomotion agents. The locomotion agents are automatically placed in the testing environment and their locomotion behavior is analyzed in the real world. This feedback is used for the design of the next iteration. Through experiments with a total of 500 autonomously built locomotion agents, this article shows diversification of morphology and behavior of physical robots for the improvement of functionality with limited resources.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015. This paper describes the real-world reproduction of a handful of robots selected from a larger sample of simulated models previously generated by an evolutionary algorithm. The five robots, which are selected by automatic clustering to be representative of different morphological niches present in the sample, are constructed in the real world using off-the-shelf motor components, combined with 3D printed structural parts that were automatically generated based on the simulator models. A lab setup, involving evolution of turning gaits for each robot, is used to automate the experiments. The forward walking speeds of the constructed robots are measured, and compared with the simulated speeds. While some of the robots achieve near-identical results, some show a large performance loss compared to their simulated prototypes, underlining the reality gap issue seen in similar previous works.},

@article{Lipson2000,
abstract = {Biological life is in control of its own means of reproduction, which generally involves complex, autocatalysing chemical reactions. But this autonomy of design and manufacture has not yet been realized artificially. Robots are still laboriously designed and constructed by teams of human engineers, usually at considerable expense. Few robots are available because these costs must be absorbed through mass production, which is justified only for toys, weapons and industrial systems such as automatic teller machines. Here we report the results of a combined computational and experimental approach in which simple electromechanical systems are evolved through simulations from basic building blocks (bars, actuators and artificial neurons); the 'fittest' machines (defined by their locomotive ability) are then fabricated robotically using rapid manufacturing technology. We thus achieve autonomy of design and construction using evolution in a 'limited universe' physical simulation coupled to automatic fabrication.},

@article{Faina2013,
abstract = {This paper is devoted to the problem of automatically designing feasible and manufacturable robots made up of heterogeneous modules. Specifically, the coevolution of morphology and control in robots is analyzed and a particular strategy to address this problem is contemplated. To this end, the main issues of this approach such as encoding, evaluation or transfer to reality are studied through the use of heterogeneous modular structures with distributed control. We also propose a constructive evolutionary algorithm based on tree-like representations of the morphology that can intrinsically provide for a type of generative evolutionary approach. The algorithm introduces some new elements to smooth the search space and make finding solutions much easier. The evaluation of the individuals is carried out in simulations and then transferred to real robots assembled from the modules considered. To this end, the extension of the principles proposed by classical authors in traditional evolutionary robotics to brain-body evolution regarding how simulations should be set up so that robust behaviors that can be transferred to reality are obtained is considered here. All these issues are analyzed by means of an evolutionary design system called EDHMoR (Evolutionary Designer of Heterogeneous Modular Robots) that contains all the elements involved in this process. To show practical evidences of the conclusions that have been extracted with this work, two benchmark problems in modular robotics are considered and EDHMoR is tested over them. The first one is focused on solving a linear robot motion mission and the second one on a static task of the robot that does not require displacements. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The pitfalls of naive robot simulations have been recognised for areas such as evolutionary robotics. It has been suggested that carefully validated simulations with a proper treatment of noise may overcome these problems. This paper reports the results of experiments intended to test some of these claims. A simulation was constructed of a two-wheeled Khepera robot with IR and ambient light sensors. This included detailed mathematical models of the robot-environment interaction dynamics with empirically determined parameters. Artificial evolution was used to develop recurrent dynamical network controllers for the simulated robot, for obstacle-avoidance and light-seeking tasks, using different levels of noise in the simulation. The evolved controllers were down-loaded onto the real robot and the correspondence between behaviour in simulation and in reality was tested. The level of correspondence varied according to how much noise was used in the simulation, with very good results achieved when realistic quantities were applied. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to develop successful robot controllers in simulation that generate almost identical behaviours in reality, at least for a particular class of robot-environment interaction dynamics.},

@inproceedings{Glette2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. In evolutionary robotics, which concerns automatic design of robotic systems using evolutionary algorithms, the well-known reality gap phenomenon occurs when transferring results from simulation to real world robots. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle this challenge, such as improving the simulator, avoiding poorly simulated solutions, or promoting robust controllers by introducing noise in the simulation. In this paper we investigate if the addition of a set of small obstacles in the simulated environment can help promote more robust gaits when transferred to a real world robot. In total 80 robot gaits are tested in the real world, evolved using flat and obstacle-seeded ground planes, and using two different scenario difficulties. The results show that in the baseline scenario the proposed obstacle method has little impact on the reality gap of the evolved gaits, whereas there is a significant reduction for the difficult scenario: The average real world performance ratio is 2.3 times higher than the result obtained with the flat plane, and there are no null-performing gaits.},

@article{Koos2013,
abstract = {The reality gap, which often makes controllers evolved in simulation inefficient once transferred onto the physical robot, remains a critical issue in evolutionary robotics (ER). We hypothesize that this gap highlights a conflict between the efficiency of the solutions in simulation and their transferability from simulation to reality: the most efficient solutions in simulation often exploit badly modeled phenomena to achieve high fitness values with unrealistic behaviors. This hypothesis leads to the transferability approach, a multiobjective formulation of ER in which two main objectives are optimized via a Pareto-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm: 1) the fitness; and 2) the transferability, estimated by a simulation-to-reality (STR) disparity measure. To evaluate this second objective, a surrogate model of the exact STR disparity is built during the optimization. This transferability approach has been compared to two reality-based optimization methods, a noise-based approach inspired from Jakobi's minimal simulation methodology and a local search approach. It has been validated on two robotic applications: 1) a navigation task with an e-puck robot; and 2) a walking task with a 8-DOF quadrupedal robot. For both experimental setups, our approach successfully finds efficient and well-transferable controllers only with about ten experiments on the physical robot.},
